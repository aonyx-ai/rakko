//! The maintenance commands of this repository
//!
//! This binary is the harness of the Rakko repository: the one place that
//! states which maintenance actions run here. It mounts the bundles and the
//! actions that this repository uses, and the command line that it builds
//! turns each of them into a command. A bundle carries a set of actions that
//! projects adopt together, so the harness names the bundle instead of each
//! action in it.
//!
//! It also mounts commands, for a maintenance activity that no single action
//! describes. A command comes from a crate, as an action does, and this file
//! names it. When a command runs actions, this file names those actions as
//! well and gives them to the command.
//!
//! Run it with `mise run rakko`, or with `rakko` where the environment
//! supplies the shortcut.
